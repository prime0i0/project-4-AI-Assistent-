Modify the Songs Function in such a way that it prompts the user to choose between different folders for songs_directory? And make sure that it does not skip the function if user says something unexpected.



        if 'play songs' in query:

            video ='D:/SONGS'

            audio = 'D:/NOKIA/Received'

            speak("What songs should i play? Audio or Video")

            ans = (TakeCommand().lower())

            while(ans != 'audio' and ans != 'video'):

                speak("I could not understand you. Please Try again.")

                ans = (TakeCommand().lower())

       

            if 'audio' in ans:

                    songs_dir = audio

                    songs = os.listdir(songs_dir)

                    print(songs)

            elif 'video' in ans:

                    songs_dir = video

                    songs = os.listdir(songs_dir)

                    print(songs)

               

            speak("select a random number")

            rand = (TakeCommand().lower())

            while('number' not in rand and rand != 'random'):

                    os.startfile(os.path.join(songs_dir,songs[rand]))

                    continue            

                elif 'random' in rand:
